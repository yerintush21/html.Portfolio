<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Yerin Cletus — a B.Sc. In Mass-communication graduate. I’m currently working with a dynamic lingerie brand where I contribute to building empowering and stylish experiences for customers.</p>
<p>Alongside my professional role, I’m actively developing my skills in web development — merging creativity with technology and enjoying the creativeness that comes with it and aspiring to expand my career possibilities.</p>

<p>In my downtime, you’ll probably find me swimming, unwinding at a seaside restaurant, or enjoying a chilled evening at a lounge.</p>

<p>I value strong relationships, transparent communication, and collaborative growth. Whether I’m learning something new or relaxing by the seaside, I believe in approaching life with balance, peace, and purpose.</p>
